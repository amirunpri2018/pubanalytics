RCR Score

`The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) is a citation-based measure of scientific influence of a publication. It is calculated as the citations of a paper, normalized to the citations received by NIH-funded publications in the same area of research and year [ref](https://dimensions.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/23000012820-what-is-the-rcr-how-is-the-rcr-score-calculated-).`

FCR Score

`The Field Citation Ratio (FCR) is a citation-based measure of scientific influence of one or more articles. It is calculated by dividing the number of citations a paper has received by the average number received by documents published in the same year and in the same Fields of Research (FoR) category.
