# Project concept

## Problem
Indonesian universities and research institutions are now trying to put their names at several known rankings. One of the criteria they promote to Indonesian researchers is H-index. Using [SINTA platform](sinta2.ristekdikti.go.id), they rank researchers based on their SINTA scores, which are calculated from Google Scholar profiles and ScopusID profiles. From each profile, the H-index is calculated to form SINTA score.

Here we argue that to rank H-index is the best way to measure researcher's impact, following these conditions: 

    - high disparity of research facilities. Research facilities in western Indonesia is better than the ones in the eastern part.
    - large variation of research ecosystem in different field of science. The sum of researchers in social/economic field is much larger than the ones working in physical science, eg: geology. 
    - lacking of skills to express ideas in English. English is not the 1st or 2nd language for Indonesian.

## Working Packages:

    1. PubAnalytics 1: [Google Scholar Classic Papers](https://osf.io/2jnb9/)
    2. PubAnalytics 2: Comparing paleo and other fields
    3. PubAnalytics 3: Cite Score
    4. PubAnalytics 4: Indonesian journal impact
